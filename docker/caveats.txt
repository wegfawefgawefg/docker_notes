you will be using sudo all the time with docker
    fixable but comes with problems, just use sudo
    reason: something about containers running as root
        or in root directory or something

docker can create lots of faux images and garbage files
    you can use $docker system prune

you cannot build arm64 docker images from amd64 directly
    you have to use qemu, emulation
    it wont complain directly if you try this
        you will get a warning... which is retarded bc its not going to work anyways
        it will just throw errors when you try to use RUN, bc host arch =/= target

once your application gets larger you probably want to setup docker yamls
    for deployment primarily, 
    can also manage building

EXPOSE 5000
    does not actually expose port 5000 to 5000
    just lets the user know when you run Docker Run, you do this
        sudo docker run -p5000:5000 gibsoncratus/thing:tag

volumes are just mounted folders that persist when the container dies
