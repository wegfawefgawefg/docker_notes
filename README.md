# Cratus Adventures

Cratus Adventures is an exploration of the CRATUS Tech Stack.

These repos should function as a starting point for anyone new to Cratus. 
Inside you will find documentation and demos for Docker, Node, React, and more to come.
It functions as onboarding educational material and as an interviewing tool, however current CRATUS Devs may find the mistakes and musings within correctably humerous, or illuminating.

While these demos are not professional implementations intended for real world deployment, they could be enhanced to become a part of production if any of them extend upon the current rich feature set of CRATUS Tech.
